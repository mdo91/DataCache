# DataCache

A SwiftUI application that displays and manages earthquake data using SwiftData for persistence. The app fetches real-time earthquake data from the USGS API and provides an interactive interface to view and filter earthquake information.

## Features

- Real-time earthquake data from USGS API
- Interactive map view showing earthquake locations
- List view with detailed earthquake information
- Filter earthquakes by date
- Sort earthquakes by magnitude or time
- Delete individual earthquakes or clear all data
- Persistent storage using SwiftData
- Beautiful and intuitive SwiftUI interface

## Requirements

- iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
